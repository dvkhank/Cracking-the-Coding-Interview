# Algorithms

## Time Complexity

**Definition:** Time complexity is a measure of the number of execution steps that an algorithm needs to complete its task when the input size increases.

- When we say the complexity is O(g(n)), it indicates the **maximum time** an algorithm takes as the input size **grows larger**.

**Efficiency:**

- Often based on time > memory usage
- Best case? Worst case?

**Execution Costs:** **Assignment, comparison, swapping**

## Types:

- **O(1) (Constant):** Execution time **does not depend on input size**. Example: Accessing an element in an array.
- **O(log n) (Logarithmic):** Execution time **increases logarithmically** with the input size. Example: Binary search.
- **O(n) (Linear):** Execution time increases **linearly** with the input size. Example: Traversing an array.
- **O(n log n):** Execution time **increases as `n log n`**. Example: Merge Sort, average-case Quick Sort.
- **O(n^2) (Squared):** Execution time **increases with the square** of the input size. Example: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort.
- **O(2^n) (Doubling):** Execution time **doubles** with each additional element. Example: Solving optimization problems using backtracking.
- **O(n!) (Very Fast Increase):** Execution time **increases very rapidly** with the input size. Example: Generating all permutations of a set.
